Birthday Application - Frontend
This is the front end of a Birthday Application, built throughout the Tech Returners Your Journey Into Tech course.

Twilio is fully functional, and allows users to set a text to automatically send at 10am on a birthday. If a person is added on the day of their birthday and it is after 10am, the user has the option to send a text straight away when adding the new birthday.

It integrates with a backend, available at https://github.com/Birthday-App-Team/birthday-backend.

The hosted version of the application is available here: https://birthday-app-team.github.io/birthday-app-frontend/
