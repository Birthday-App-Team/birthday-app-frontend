This is the front end of a Birthday Application, built throughout the Tech Returners Your Journey Into Tech course.

The hosted version of the application is available here: https://birthday-app-team.github.io/birthday-app-frontend/

It integrates with a backend, available at https://github.com/Birthday-App-Team/birthday-backend.

Users can view a sorted list of birthdays, add new birthdays, edit existing birthdays and delete.

Twilio
The app also uses Twilio to allow users to set a text to automatically send at 10am on a birthday. If a person is added on the day of their birthday and it is after 10am, the user has the option to send a text straight away when adding the new birthday.
